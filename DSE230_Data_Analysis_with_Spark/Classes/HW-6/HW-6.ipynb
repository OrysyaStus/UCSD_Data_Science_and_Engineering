    "# Homework 6\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, we are going to play with Twitter data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is represented as rows of of [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Example) strings.\n",
    "It consists of [tweets](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/tweets), [messages](https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview/messages-types), and a small amount of broken data (cannot be parsed as JSON).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this homework, we will only focus on tweets and ignore all other messages.\n",

    "## Tweets\n",
    "\n",
    "A tweet consists of many data fields. [Here is an example](https://gist.github.com/arapat/03d02c9b327e6ff3f6c3c5c602eeaf8b). You can learn all about them in the Twitter API doc. We are going to briefly introduce only the data fields that will be used in this homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `created_at`: Posted time of this tweet (time zone is included)\n",
    "* `id_str`: Tweet ID - we recommend using `id_str` over using `id` as Tweet IDs, becauase `id` is an integer and may bring some overflow problems.\n",
    "* `text`: Tweet content\n",
    "* `user`: A JSON object for information about the author of the tweet\n",
    "    * `id_str`: User ID\n",
    "    * `name`: User name (may contain spaces)\n",
    "    * `screen_name`: User screen name (no spaces)\n",
    "* `retweeted_status`: A JSON object for information about the retweeted tweet (i.e. this tweet is not original but retweeteed some other tweet)\n",
    "    * All data fields of a tweet except `retweeted_status`\n",
    "* `entities`: A JSON object for all entities in this tweet\n",
    "    * `hashtags`: An array for all the hashtags that are mentioned in this tweet\n",
    "    * `urls`: An array for all the URLs that are mentioned in this tweet\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data source\n",
    "\n",
    "All tweets are collected using the [Twitter Streaming API](https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Users partition\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the original tweets, we will provide you with a Pickle file, which contains a partition over 452,743 Twitter users. It contains a Python dictionary `{user_id: partition_id}`. The users are partitioned into 7 groups."
